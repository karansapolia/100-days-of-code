# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Created a Gatsby.js blog 

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with React and Gatsby Modules, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. React is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Dec 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Successfully deployed the Gatsby.js blog I created yesterday

**Thoughts** Figuring out how to deploy in Github Pages was something. A simple push does not enable the React style and components. Had to deploy through npm and use some pre-defined scripts like 'gh-pages', provided by Gatsby itself.
